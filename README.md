# Product Management System
This is a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) app project using React-Redux Rtk Query. Express Js is also used for request response handling of data with the server. Since the Image upload is difficult with Json-Server alone, Express js is used instead of Json-server. This project is built with Vite for faster development experience and tailwind css for styling.

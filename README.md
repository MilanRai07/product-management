# Product Management System
This is a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) app project using React-Redux Rtk Query. Express.js is used for handling the request-response cycle, ensuring efficient communication between the client and the server. Since the Image upload doesn't work with Json-Server, Express js is used instead of Json-server. This project is built with Vite for faster development experience and tailwind css for styling.
